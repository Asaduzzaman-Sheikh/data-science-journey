# Chapter 1: What is Correlation?

## 🎯 The Fundamental Question

Before diving into any math or formulas, correlation answers one simple question:

> **"When one thing changes, does the other thing tend to change too?"**

---

## 📖 Definition

### Intuitive Definition
**Correlation** is a way to measure **whether two things tend to move together**.

### Key Insight
Correlation is about **patterns** and **tendencies**, not absolute rules.

- We say "tend to" — not "always" or "definitely"
- A tall person *might* weigh less than a short person
- A student who studies a lot *might* still fail
- But **on average**, **in general** — we see a pattern

## 🎭 Real-Life Examples

| Example | Relationship |
|---------|--------------|
| Study hours ↔ Exam scores | Students who study more *tend to* score higher |
| Temperature ↔ Ice cream sales | As temperature rises, ice cream sales *tend to* rise |
| Exercise ↔ Body weight | People who exercise more *tend to* weigh less |
| Age ↔ Shoe size (adults) | No relationship — shoe size doesn't change with age |
| Class participation ↔ Teacher recognition | More participation → Teacher notices you more |

## ⚠️ Critical Rule: Correlation ≠ Causation

This is one of the most important concepts in statistics!

### What It Means
> **Correlation only tells us that two things move together — it says NOTHING about whether one causes the other.**

### Classic Example
**Ice cream sales** and **drowning deaths** are correlated:
- Both increase in summer
- Both decrease in winter

Does ice cream cause drowning? **Absolutely not!**

A **third factor** (hot weather) causes both:
- Hot weather → People buy ice cream
- Hot weather → People go swimming → More drownings

### Remember
- Correlation: "These two things move together"
- Causation: "This thing CAUSES that thing"
- **Moving together ≠ Causing each other**

## 🔑 Key Takeaways

1. **Correlation measures tendency** — how two variables move in relation to each other
2. **It's about patterns**, not guarantees
3. **Correlation ≠ Causation** — this cannot be emphasized enough
4. **Knowing correlation helps prediction** — if two things are correlated, knowing one helps us guess the other

## 📝 Self-Check Questions

1. In your own words, what does correlation measure?
2. True or False: If two variables are correlated, knowing one helps us predict the other.
3. Why does correlation NOT imply causation?
4. Give an example where two things are correlated but one doesn't cause the other.
